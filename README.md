# Movie-Recommender-System-Using-User-Based-Collaborating-Filtering

Recommender systems are algorithms designed to help users discover movies, products, and songs by predicting the userâ€™s rating of each     item and displaying similar items that they might rate high as well.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                           
The objective is to show customers content that they would like best based on their historical activity.                                  
                                                                                                                                           
Recommender systems are used to suggest movies or songs to users based on their interest or usage history.                                 
For example, Netflix recommends movies to watch based on the previous movies you've watched.
