# Movie-Recommender-System-Using-User-Based-Collaborating-Filtering

Recommender systems are algorithms designed to help users discover movies, products, and songs by predicting the user’s rating of each     item and displaying similar items that they might rate high as well.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                           
The objective is to show customers content that they would like best based on their historical activity.                                  
                                                                                                                                           
Recommender systems are used to suggest movies or songs to users based on their interest or usage history.                                 
For example, Netflix recommends movies to watch based on the previous movies you've watched.                                                
Used Item-based Collaborative Filter                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                          
User-based collaborative filtering works by building a matrix of every piece of content that users bought or viewed.                       
Similarity scores are then calculated between users to find similar users to each others.                                                 
For similar users, content that have not been viewed or bought are recommended to users that haven’t seen them before.
